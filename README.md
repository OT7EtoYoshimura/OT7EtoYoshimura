# You've been blessed by the Joe with strong arms
###### Concurrency is not parallelism is concurrency
#### May your processes be plenty and your programs forever lasting
#### Your memory not shared and your messages passed,
#### Your variables invariable and your data algebraically typed,
#### Should your applications become glorious trees, sprawling amongst many alike in the BEAM
#### ...you'll witness true beauty.
